# Webmaster
This is my solution for the 2025 TSA Webmaster Challenge. The requirements of this challenge are listed below.

## Challenge
Design a website for a vegan/vegetarian restaurant. Showcase the restaurantâ€™s approach (such as farm-to-table, preparation processes, and sustainability) to the food served in the restaurant.

## Approach
Using the powerful JavaScript framework, React, I was able to build a website for a vegetarian restaraunt that not only deliveres the information required, but also has additional components that grab the user's attention. Examples include the gradient colors used on important phrases, a seamless user experience, a responsive navbar, and an option to switch to dark mode. Many other eye catching features exist within this app that aren't apparent to the user such as Suspense, Routing, and Context.

## Update
To update the contents of this website, run the following commands in the webmaster folder.
* `$ git add .`
* `$ git commit -m "<describe the changes here>"`
* `$ git push`
* and finally `$ npm run deploy`
